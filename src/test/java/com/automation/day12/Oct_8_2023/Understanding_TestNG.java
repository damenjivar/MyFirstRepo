	// what is TestNG
	// TestNG full form is Test New Generation

	// why was TestNG introduced?
	// selenium does not support Test Reporting. Earlier it used JUnit but Junit is
	// not good for reporting
	// Mostly Junit was used by developers

	// what exactly TestNG does?
	// 1. It is an Execution engine. That means when you are using TestNG is Java
	// language you do not need main method.
	// 2. It is a reporting system. So TestNG when integrated with Selenium
	// organizes professional Test Reports.
	// 3. It is a framework in itself. So you can organize your complete project
	// using TestNG.

	// what are the topics you need to cover to understand TestNG?
	// 1. Installation of TestNG
	// 2. Add TestNG library to your Maven Project
	// 3. You need to add TestNG dependency in your pom.xml file
	// 4. The meaning of <scope>test</scope> and we can replace test with compile in
	// case you want it to execute everywhere.
	// 5. Whenever you create a Class in which you want to use TestNG, do not
	// introduce main method in it.
	// 6. Understanding and memorizing all annotations of TestNG
	// 7. You cannot just write the annotation and try to import it. It will give
	// you error.
	// 8. Every annotation has to be followed up by creation of a method. Preferably
	// choose non-static method.
