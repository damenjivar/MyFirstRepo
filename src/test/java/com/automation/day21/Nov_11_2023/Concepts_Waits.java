	// 1. Implicit Wait -

	// 2. Explicit Wait -

	// 3. Fluent Wait - Fluent Wait is like a smart way for your computer program to
	// wait and check if something it's looking for on a webpage has appeared.
	// Instead of just freezing for a set amount of time, it keeps looking at the
	// webpage every few seconds until it finds what it's searching for or until it
	// decides it's waited long enough. It's like patiently looking for a friend in
	// a crowd, checking every few seconds instead of just standing there and
	// waiting without any idea of when your friend will show up.
	
	// Fluent Wait in Java with Selenium is a mechanism for handling synchronization
	// in test automation, allowing flexible waiting for a specified condition with
	// a fluent, expressive coding style, including customizable maximum wait time
	// and polling intervals.
