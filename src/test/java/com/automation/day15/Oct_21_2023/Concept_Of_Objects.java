	// what are the ways of creating an Object in java?
	// Answer: there are 5 ways we can create an Object in java
	// 1. new keyword
	// 2. newInstance() method
	// 3. clone() method
	// 4. deserialization
	// 5. factory methods

	// What is an Object?
	// Bookish definition: Object is instance of a class.
	// Objects occupy memory. Because they are physical entities.
	
	//Animal as Class and Dog as an Object
	//Road as Class and SUV car as Object

	// What are the properties of an Object?
	// 1. Identity[name]
	// 2. State[breed / color / age]
	// 3. Behavior[barking / aggressive / drinks / eats / sleeps / plays]
	
	//Categorization or representational definition of an object is easier compared to a class
	//determining dimensions for an object is simpler compared to a Class
	
	//Java definition: Object is collection of all non-static entities of the Class.

	// What is instance? single occurence

	// What do you mean by a Class cannot be instantiated? You cannot have objects
	// for this class. And this is specific to some pre-defined classes in java. An
	// example is System Class.

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello Object");
	}
}
