public class Constructor_Concepts {

	// constructor is a block which looks like a method but it is not a method

	// constructors do not have a return type, not even void

	// public, private, protected, default - all these access modifiers can be used
	// with Constructors

	// a constructor is invoked when an Object is created.

	// Obviously name of the Constructor is == name of the Class

	// Question: what are the uses of constructor?
	// Answer: 1. Used to initialize an Object
	// 2. optimize the code

	// Question: what are the types of constructors?
	// Answer: 1. Default constructor
	// 2. No argument constructor (user defined)
