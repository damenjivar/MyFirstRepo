	// Exception occurs because of programming logical errors v/s Error occurs
	// because of lack of System resources (internet went out, hard disc crashed,
	// CPU went off, battery died on battery while coding, etc).

	// Exceptions are recoverable v/s Errors are not recoverable (in that point in
	// time)
	
	// Exceptions are of two types - CompileTime(checked) Exceptions or
	// RunTime(unchecked) Exceptions

	// v/s Errors are only RunTime Exceptions
