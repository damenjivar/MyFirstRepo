	// 0 to 100% abstraction.
	// Abstract class can have both abstract(undefined/unimplemented) methods and
	// concrete methods(simple/regular).

	// A concrete(simple/regular) class can extend an abstract class (parent) but it
	// has to implement the undefined methods of the abstract class.

	// You cannot create the object of abstract class

	// A normal class cannot have abstract methods
	// an abstract class can have abstract methods as well as regular methods
