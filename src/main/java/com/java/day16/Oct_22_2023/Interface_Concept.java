	// What is an interface?

	// 100% abstraction

	// Interface is Blueprint of a Class
	// It tells a Class what to do but it does not tell how to do it.
	// Methods inside the interface are abstract and public
	// Variables are final, static and public
	// From JDK8 default concrete methods were allowed
	// from JDK9 private concrete methods were allowed
	// from JDK8 static concrete methods were allowed

	// A concrete[simple/regular/normal] class which implements the interface is
	// known as the implementing class of that interface.
	
	// One concrete class can implement multiple interfaces - this is the only place
	// where multiple inheritance is allowed in Java.
	
	// When a concrete Class implements an interface, it also has to implement all
	// the abstract methods of the interface.
	
	// A concrete class can extend an Abstract Class as well as implement an
	// interface or implement multiple interfaces.
